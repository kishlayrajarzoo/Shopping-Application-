# Shopping-Application-
Developed a robust and scalable Online Shopping Application leveraging a microservices architecture to handle core functionalities like Product, Order, and Inventory management. The system ensures efficient communication, secure access control, and seamless monitoring, providing an end-to-end shopping experience.

Key Features:

Microservices Design:
Separated Product, Order, and Inventory services into independent, deployable units for modularity and scalability.
Asynchronous Communication:
Established event-driven communication between Order and Inventory services using Kafka and RabbitMQ to ensure reliability and fault tolerance.
Authentication & Authorization:
Secured the application with Keycloak, implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) for enhanced security.
Service Discovery:
Integrated Eureka for centralized service discovery and load balancing to optimize inter-service interactions.
Centralized Logging:
Configured Elasticsearch and Kibana for efficient logging, monitoring, and debugging.
Containerization:
Deployed all microservices using Docker, enabling easy scaling and portability.
Technologies Used:

Languages & Frameworks: Java, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud, Hibernate
Messaging & Queueing: Kafka, RabbitMQ
Security: Keycloak
Service Discovery: Eureka
Logging & Monitoring: Elasticsearch, Kibana
Containerization: Docker
This project demonstrates a hands-on approach to designing and implementing a full-stack, microservice-based system that adheres to modern software development principles.
